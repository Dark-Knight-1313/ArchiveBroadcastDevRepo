As business grew, his brother, Matt, joined the company to head up operations. The two began by selling and shipping fresh Maryland crab caught daily by local watermen. Their unique packing and delivery processes kept crabs at their freshest, and our satisfied customer base grew quickly. As a result, the company received the SBA Maryland Entrepreneurial Success of the Year Award in 2001. (see what the media is saying about <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>®) In 2005, Greg and Matt invited Rebecca Gareis Bent into the <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>® family to be in charge of product development, photography, and marketing. She is a Baltimore native and the author of the cookbooks Burgers (2004), Down at the Shore (2006), and Everyday is Delicious (2007). She has been featured on The Today Show and ESPN, and in Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and elsewhere. Her crab cake recipe earned <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>® recognition as “The Best” online crab cakes in 2006 from Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine’s Annual “Best of the Best” Edition. (check out what Rebecca is blogging about) Greg, Matt, and Rebecca have been crabbing since they could walk, and still have fun pulling them in and teaching their own kids.
