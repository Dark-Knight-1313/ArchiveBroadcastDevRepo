Prior to her tenure at <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>®, Inc. Carman was serving as a server and taking courses at a local community college to become a Kindergarten teacher. In 2017, after the restaurant she was working for was sold, Carman applied for an opening with Crab Place® as a Customer Service Specialist. At this time the Crab Place® was much smaller, and Carman handled the roles of answering phones and shipping boxes. In 2019 Carman was promoted to Operations Manager where she ensured all orders were correctly packed, production needs were met, new hires were trained, invoices were turned in, and inventory was accounted for, in addition to managing the servers for the Crab Place® other business, Crab and Cruise, Inc. When the pandemic hit, business at Crab Place® skyrocketed, and the company grew past anything they had ever seen. To accommodate the growth, Crab Place® needed leaders with experience, and thus the first Zone was created with Carman at the helm. Now as the Assistant Director of Zone 1, Carman’s role has expanded to include processing of products, shipping and receiving, continuous improvement, and the management of six other team members, making her zone the largest in the building. Carman is HACCP and Lean Six Sigma Yellow and Green Belt certified. She also holds certifications in Leadership, Supervision and Management, and Inventory Management. When not working hard to make sure your orders are packaged and shipped out correctly, Carman enjoys spending time with her family and their two cats Mobi and

Although he worked for <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>®, Inc. seasonally by helping with Hard Crabs, driving for Crab Trips, and serving for Crab & Cruise, Inc. events, Matt never saw himself joining the family business full-time. After high school Matt began to pursue a degree in Business Administration at Salisbury University, thinking he would like to start his own business someday. However, feeling that the business courses came naturally to him, he ended up switching his major to Conflict Analysis and Dispute Resolution to give him a broader knowledge base – a choice that would later assist him in his ability to lead as an Assistant Site Director. After graduating with his Bachelor's, and not really having a clear direction set yet, Matt moved to Baltimore to work in Sales for AT&T. In the Fall of 2020, Matt was recruited to come back to <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>®, Inc. as a Customer Service Specialist, and then in early 2021, he was ushered into the role of Quality Assurance Manager, where he became responsible for ensuring that the products we buy meet the standards of excellence that we believe in. After thriving in this role, Matt’s position further expanded in 2022 when the Hard Crab Zone was officially created, and he stepped in to take over as the Assistant Director. Matt still works to buy products from vendors of the highest quality, all while ensuring that the crabs you get meet your level of satisfaction. He is Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certified and OSHA Forklift certified.

After being interviewed and offered a position as a Customer Service Specialist, Mercedes put her education goals on hold to see what this new opportunity would create for her. Although never having worked in an office setting before, Mercedes’ serving experience proved valuable in helping her deal with customer interactions. Within less than a year Mercedes was promoted to a Lead position, and then in 2022, she was promoted again to Customer Service Manager. In 2023, Mercedes’s position in the company expanded even further as she took on the responsibility of Human Resources and Chargeback management and was promoted into her current role. Because of Mercedes’s incredibly hard-working attitude and effort, she has marked herself as an individual capable of growing into any role she is given. She personally aspires to further her professional knowledge, especially in Human Resources, so she can continue to add value to the company as it grows.

In 2019, Arielle started out as a seasonal employee coming in around the holidays to help seal and label boxes and assist with making our delicious crab cakes. In 2020 when the pandemic hit, business for the Crab Place® began to boom, and since universities were temporarily shut down, Arielle was able to start summer early, working full-time in the Crab Place® processing department until the universities opened back up in the Fall. In between Grad School semesters, Arielle returned to the Crab Place® in the summer of 2021 to assist in the hard crab division, learning yet another new aspect of the business – grading each individual crab to ensure excellence is shipped out of our doors. After spending much time working for <a href=\"https:\/\/cplr-dev.myshopify.com\/\" title=\"The Crab Place®\">CrabPlace.com<\/a>®, Inc., Arielle knew she would like to continue working with the company, however, preferably in a less physically demanding role. In 2022, while still finishing up Grad School for her Master’s in Health and Human Performance, Arielle was hired as an accounting assistant to the company’s former Director of Finance. After a year in this role, and some company restructuring, she was promoted to an Assistant Director role of the newly formed Zone 4: Finance and Marketing. Outside of working to develop her zone, Arielle enjoys traveling to new places and visiting her family.<\/p>","text_size":3,"text_style":"font-body","button_text":"","button_url":"","button_type":"btn--primary hero__btn","button_style":"btn--solid","show_arrow":false}}},"block_order":["2685ab59-f8f6-4146-8ea2-0f24da39f1e8","ec7c5c0c-7381-4410-aa4a-254e93f303f9","f4ead105-985d-450b-b977-171cfcd2bd41"],"settings":{"title":"","heading_size":5,"align_text":"text-left","align_columns":"flex-align-top","width":"wrapper--full-padded","bg_color":"","color":"","padding_top":50,"padding_bottom":50,"layout_mobile":"carousel"}}},"order":["main","team-0","68b1a943-3ebe-4cce-bed2-f54343ea4b91","b214d706-f31b-4bbe-902e-c7a33d107e92","647e2b62-66cf-45de-ba01-a8f1049c7aff","ac3c8761-9c99-45a5-abc1-11dbc0a8214b","25d64eaa-1c3f-4799-ae3e-46d67a4a495b","team-1","team-2","43d8b79d-1f7a-4c26-a057-9553a31812ea","29cd5034-85a8-4b3f-b0ae-0d81a0f618ff"]}
